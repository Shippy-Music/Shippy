# Shippy Live Status

**Updated:** 2026-07-25  
**Current stage:** Stage 1 — Shippy shell over preserved Auxio playback  
**Overall state:** In progress

This is the first file to read after `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` whenever work resumes.
Keep it factual and short. Move durable decisions into the canonical documents.

## Completed

- Product owner confirmed Android-only direction.
- Product owner confirmed actual Auxio/Kotlin foundation.
- Clean Auxio source cloned into `X:\piko\shippy` on upstream `dev`.
- Clean Bloomee donor source exists at `X:\piko\bloomee`.
- Canonical product contract created in `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
- Detailed UX contract created in `docs/UX.md`.
- Detailed Crew contract created in `docs/CREW.md`.
- Executable staged plan created in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Goal constraint recorded: no repeated heavy Android/Gradle builds on this PC.
- Auxio foundation audit completed with exact source references.
- Bloomee donor audit completed with exact source references.
- Architecture and keep/extend/add/replace boundary documented.
- Working branch frozen from Auxio `dev` as `shippy/main`.
- Graphify code maps created for Auxio `:app` and `:musikr` and merged locally.
- First Shippy code seam implemented:
  - Canonical identifiers, Track, TrackCandidate, QueueItem, and availability.
  - Deterministic playback resolver with Local separation and Crew policy.
  - Eight focused resolver/domain tests authored.
- Exact `musikr.Song` adapter and compatibility resolver implemented without
  changing Auxio's runtime playback path.
- Permanent Liked, Downloads, and Local collection rules modelled.
- Provider capability/health/priority contracts implemented.
- Download lifecycle reducer implemented through verified permanent artifact.
- Deterministic Crew state/event reducer implemented with equal-member queue and
  playback actions, sequence/term checks, snapshot gaps, and coordinator transfer.
- Shippy app label and required network permissions introduced.
- Four primary destinations implemented in the real Android navigation graph:
  Home, Search, Library, and Crew.
- Auxio mini-player/full-player/queue sheets retained and offset above the
  primary navigation; full-player expansion fades navigation away.
- Top-level destination state restoration and Library-only Auxio FAB behavior
  implemented.
- Home now reflects real current playback and real local-library statistics.
- Search is a top-level destination; the mature Auxio local library is retained
  under Library.
- JioSaavn media URL/response utilities and LRC parser ported with focused tests.

## In Progress

- Static review of the new Android shell and inset/mini-player integration.
- Wiring provider-backed search and permanent collection persistence.
- Crew transport/session engine behind the new Crew destination.

## Not Started

- Full Gradle/Android build.
- Physical-device verification.

## Current Risks

- Auxio upstream `dev` has documented Windows build limitations that require
  exact verification before selecting the day-to-day development branch.
- Bloomee provider logic is Dart/Flutter and must be ported/reimplemented, not
  assumed reusable as native Kotlin.
- Crew transport must be proven with a focused spike before committing to a
  networking library.
- Final device behavior is deliberately unverified until the owner performs the
  build/test handoff.

## Next Concrete Actions

1. Commit the statically reviewed Shippy shell.
2. Implement permanent collection persistence and Library projection.
3. Implement the first complete provider adapter and unified search repository.
4. Continue the local/provider playback vertical slice through Auxio Media3.

## Verification Ledger

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Product requirements | Inspected and documented | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` |
| UX requirements | Documented | `UX.md` |
| Crew behavior | Documented | `CREW.md` |
| Auxio foundation | Inspected | `AUXIO_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md` |
| Bloomee donor | Inspected | `BLOOMEE_DONOR_AUDIT.md` |
| App code | Implemented, not compiled | Domain, provider, download, local adapter, Crew reducer |
| New tests | Authored, not run | Resolver, collections, provider registry, download, Crew |
| Static structure | Parsed | Graphify AST extraction and XML parsing |
| APK/device | Not verified | Owner handoff stage |
