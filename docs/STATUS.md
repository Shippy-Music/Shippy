# Shippy Live Status

**Updated:** 2026-07-25  
**Current stage:** Stage 1 foundation seam — canonical playback domain  
**Overall state:** In progress

This is the first file to read after `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` whenever work resumes.
Keep it factual and short. Move durable decisions into the canonical documents.

## Completed

- Product owner confirmed Android-only direction.
- Product owner confirmed actual Auxio/Kotlin foundation.
- Clean Auxio source cloned into `X:\piko\shippy` on upstream `dev`.
- Clean Bloomee donor source exists at `X:\piko\bloomee`.
- Canonical product contract created in `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
- Detailed UX contract created in `docs/UX.md`.
- Detailed Crew contract created in `docs/CREW.md`.
- Executable staged plan created in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Goal constraint recorded: no repeated heavy Android/Gradle builds on this PC.
- Auxio foundation audit completed with exact source references.
- Bloomee donor audit completed with exact source references.
- Architecture and keep/extend/add/replace boundary documented.
- Working branch frozen from Auxio `dev` as `shippy/main`.
- Graphify code maps created for Auxio `:app` and `:musikr` and merged locally.
- First Shippy code seam implemented:
  - Canonical identifiers, Track, TrackCandidate, QueueItem, and availability.
  - Deterministic playback resolver with Local separation and Crew policy.
  - Eight focused resolver/domain tests authored.

## In Progress

- Local `musikr.Song` to Shippy candidate adapter design.
- Compatibility seam between Shippy resolved playback and existing Auxio player.

## Not Started

- Full Gradle/Android build.
- Physical-device verification.

## Current Risks

- Auxio upstream `dev` has documented Windows build limitations that require
  exact verification before selecting the day-to-day development branch.
- Bloomee provider logic is Dart/Flutter and must be ported/reimplemented, not
  assumed reusable as native Kotlin.
- Crew transport must be proven with a focused spike before committing to a
  networking library.
- Final device behavior is deliberately unverified until the owner performs the
  build/test handoff.

## Next Concrete Actions

1. Add the `musikr.Song` local candidate adapter.
2. Characterize the current local playback media-source seam.
3. Introduce compatibility mapping without changing runtime behavior.
4. Continue the first local-playback vertical slice.

## Verification Ledger

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Product requirements | Inspected and documented | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` |
| UX requirements | Documented | `UX.md` |
| Crew behavior | Documented | `CREW.md` |
| Auxio foundation | Inspected | `AUXIO_FOUNDATION_AUDIT.md` |
| Bloomee donor | Inspected | `BLOOMEE_DONOR_AUDIT.md` |
| App code | Implemented, not compiled | Canonical domain and resolver |
| New tests | Authored, not run | `PlaybackResolverTest.kt` |
| Static structure | Parsed | Graphify extracted new Kotlin files |
| APK/device | Not verified | Owner handoff stage |
