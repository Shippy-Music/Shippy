# Shippy R16 Status

**Updated:** 2026-08-19  
**Active phase:** Phase 1 — Urgent R15.3 Correctness Repairs  
**Authority:** `../Shippy_R16_Master_Architecture_and_Implementation_Spec.md`

## Execution mandate

The product owner permanently authorized execution of the complete R16 program.
Do not ask for another general "go" after context compaction. Stop only for an
owner decision that the master specification explicitly marks as blocking.

Build and Gradle caches must be retained between builds. Clear them only after a
specific cache-corruption diagnosis.

Treat the master specification as a compass, not a literal transcription task:
its invariants, data-safety rules, authority boundaries, and required outcomes
are binding, while suggested class names, exact commit counts, and implementation
details may adapt to current evidence. Prefer practical coherent slices and
avoid checklist theatre.

## Current authority state

- R15.3 legacy database, playback manager, Library, and UI remain active.
- No R16 runtime authority is active yet.
- R16 feature flags have not been introduced.
- The master specification supersedes conflicting pre-R16 product,
  architecture, implementation, UX, stabilization, and completion claims.

## Last passing gate

- The Aug-19 source archive matches all 1,235 files in the imported worktree.
- The imported snapshot is committed at `491a1abc0` and tagged
  `r15.3-stabilized-20260819` on `r16/architecture-reset`.
- Source ZIP and APK checksums match the documented stabilization evidence.
- The master specification was copied byte-for-byte into the repository and its
  checksum was verified.
- The tall-player seek bar again uses content height while the 304dp preview
  remains owned by the lyrics container.
- Playlist order controls now live in a playlist-only layout and no longer
  inflate on Songs, Albums, Artists, or Genres.
- The focused layout regression suite passes both ownership invariants.
- New playback now validates its target and records the expected queue-item ID
  before any Media3 mutation can synchronously publish a transition callback.

## Current blockers

- The final public application ID string requires owner selection before the
  dependent namespace/package migration is locked.
- A redacted real owner-device v10 database fixture is required before importer
  cutover can be proven.
- Physical-device verification remains unavailable until a device is attached;
  it does not block pure core or deterministic migration work.

## Next exact slice

1. Give Last.fm a continuous audible clock and refresh its queue projection on
   reorder.
2. Bound collection composition, queue display projection, and managed-download
   rediscovery before establishing `:shippy-core`.

## Verification level

Baseline preservation is checksum-verified. Changed app Kotlin and Android
resources compile. `R16LayoutRegressionTest` passes (2 tests), and the focused
playback identity/transition suites pass (11 tests). No R16 code has been
instrumented, device-tested, or performance-tested.
